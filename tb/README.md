# Testbench for the MMU

Testbench includes fetching ports that generate random and sequential virtual addresses for the instruction and data address translations. TB also includes test logic commands to maximize the coverage and CSR port for producing common control signals. It was designed for cases when it will be beneficial to create random privilege level control flags run time. However, for now, it contains only default assignments. The incomplete part of the testbench job is to finish the tb_mem to emulate the golden model for MMU checks. Physical addresses coming from the MMU (potentially TLB) should be compared against these "actual" results in each generator port to verify the module and spot some exceptions. Due to the massive address space of the page table walk, it might be helpful to prepare the actual results in a standalone file in advance for respective random/sequential virtual page numbers and compare them against MMU outputs. Other options are also possible.

Testbenches are written in SystemVerilog (without support for UVM) based on Ariane's Write Through D-cache testbench model.  The updated makefile contains some commands to run the tb with VCS in addition to the ModelSim support.
